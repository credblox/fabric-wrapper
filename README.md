Blox-network is part of the Blox framework suite.

What is blox framework?

    - Blox toolkit provides a framework & set of guiding principles that makes it easy to build & operate a blockchain network
    - Why an open source framework for blockchain?
        - blox <3 open source
        - Parts of what we could build with blox is powered by what has been a remarkable contribution from open source community to the hyperledger fabric platform
        - Open consensus about the type of network being deployed
    - Basic implementation flow
        - Build network > Invoke & instantiate chain-code > Operate the network
